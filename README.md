# Custom Unity Visual Scripting
A workshop space to tinker with how to make new custom nodes.


## Plans
- Node Descriptors for every custom node
- ~~Multi-Input Multiplication Node~~
    - ~~Subtraction and Division as well~~
- ~~Layermask comparison~~
    - Flow-Branching Select-Style node based on object layer
- Bitwise operators
- Multi-Input boolean operators and maybe some others
- Rounding to specific amounts of decimals
    - Component-wise support for vectors
    - [More planning required] Extra node that will avoid rounding to important breakpoints (e.g. dont display 0 health while on 0.3, display 1)

A workshop space to tinker with how to make new custom nodes.


## Plans
- Node Descriptors for every custom node
- ~~Multi-Input Multiplication Node~~
    - ~~Subtraction and Division as well~~
- ~~Layermask comparison~~
    - Flow-Branching Select-Style node based on object layer
- Bitwise operators
- Multi-Input boolean operators and maybe some others
